# Hibernate Bytecode instrumentation/enhancement

This is a sample project that shows how to enable hibernate bytecode
enhancements.

Hibernate will enhance the classes in an applicationâ€™s domain
model in order to add one or more of the following capabilities:

- Lazy state initialization
- Dirtiness tracking
- Automatic bi-directional association management
- Performance optimizations

### HowTo 

There are two build files in that project that allow you to
choose between an enhanced version and a regular version:

- ``build-withEnhancement.gradle``   
- ``build-noEnhancement.gradle``

Use these build files (either by using the gradle option "-b" ir by simply
copying over the content to build.gradle) and then run the tests in the class
``AssetTest``.

You can either use containers (see the note in the testclass for more
information) for testing or a local postgresql database.
